# simon-game
A browser-based version of the classic 80s hand-held memory game. Remember the sequence of lights and sounds, and see if you can achieve victory with a score of 20!

# demo
Demo app here: [http://ortonomy.github.io/simon-game/](http://ortonomy.github.io/simon-game/)

# technology
Built using HTML, SCSS, CSS, vanilla JavaScript ES6, and the WebAudio API

# features
Current functionalities include:

- Computer generated sequences includes lights (desktop and mobile) and sounds (desktop only).
- Repeat the sequence to increase your score by 1.
- Try to achieve a score of 20 to win.
- Reacts to errors and repeats the sequence to let you try again.
- Includes 'strict' mode. If you make a mistake, the sequence starts again from 0/
- Sounds generated by WebAudio API oscillators:  [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode)
- _analogue_ power button
- 7-segment display font for a little retro feel
- flat UI design for a complementary modern feel

# future improvements
Planned features include:
- decreasing delays for displaying the sequence at higher indexes thus ramping the difficultly level
- abstracting the timer durations to the ``Game.settings`` object to allow easy customisation and tweaking
- implementing sounds for mobile browsers using embedded html ``<audio>`` tags and sounds files instead of WebAudio API
- optimizing touch events to handle 300ms delay between ``touchend`` and ``click`` events.
